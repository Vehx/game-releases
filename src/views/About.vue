      Game Releases
    </h1>
    <h3>This site is under construction :)</h3>
    <p class="tiny">please excuse the noise</p>
    <p>
      When it's done it will show game releases of the coming week.
    </p>
    <p>
      There will also be a search so you can find a game you're looking forward
      to.
    </p>
    <p>
      And a watchlist that you can add games to and keep track of. (Only saved
      locally)
